# emf-kaizen-experiments

This repository collects experimental artifacts associated with research
papers that evaluate the EMF-Kaizen approach.

It serves as a central archive for experimental data, models, requests,
and evaluation results, organised by publication venue.

Each top-level directory corresponds to a specific conference or journal
paper and contains all materials required to inspect and reproduce the
experiments reported in that paper.

Refer to the `README.md` inside each paper-specific folder for details
about the corresponding experiments.
