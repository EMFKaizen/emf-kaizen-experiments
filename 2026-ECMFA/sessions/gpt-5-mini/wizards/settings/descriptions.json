  "wizards.ecore": "The meta-model is designed to facilitate the creation of wizards, which are interactive user interfaces that guide users through a multi-step process. The key entities in this metamodel are the `Wizard`, `Page`, `Field`, `Checkbox`, and various `Button` types.\r\n\r\n### Summary of Selected Entities:\r\n\r\n1. **Wizard**: \r\n   - The primary entity representing a wizard interface. It comprises multiple `Page` elements and has attributes such as `title`.\r\n   - A `Wizard` is expected to have one or more `Page` instances (stored in a containment relationship), with one designated as the `initialPage`, serving as the entry point for users.\r\n\r\n2. **Page**: \r\n   - Represents individual steps within the wizard. Each `Page` is characterized by its `name` and contains several components organized into fields, buttons, and a checkbox.\r\n   - The relationship between `Page` and `Wizard` is bidirectional, meaning each page references its owning wizard. A `Page` contains zero or more `Field` instances and `Button` instances, facilitating interactive input and navigation.\r\n\r\n3. **Field**: \r\n   - Defines input fields within a `Page`, each characterized by attributes such as `label`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `anyLength`, and `isPassword`. These attributes determine the behavior and constraints of user input.\r\n\r\n4. **Checkbox**: \r\n   - A special type of interactive component on a `Page`, defined by its `label` and a boolean `checked` state, allowing users to select or deselect options.\r\n\r\n5. **Button** (Abstract Class): \r\n   - Serves as a parent class for various button types within a `Page`, characterized by a `label` attribute. Specific button actions will be defined in subclasses.\r\n\r\n   - **NavigateButton**: A concrete subclass of `Button` that includes a `toPage` reference, allowing users to navigate to another `Page` within the `Wizard`.\r\n   - **BackButton**: A specific button type for navigating back to the previous step in the wizard, inheriting common properties from `Button`.\r\n   - **ShowMessageButton**: Displays a message to the user through a `messageText` attribute when clicked.\r\n   - **CloseWizardButton**: This button type is used to terminate the wizard interaction.\r\n\r\n### Relationships:\r\n- The entities collectively demonstrate a hierarchical and compositional structure, where a `Wizard` encapsulates multiple `Page` instances, each containing user interaction elements like `Field`, `Checkbox`, and various `Button` types. This structure allows for a modular approach to designing wizards, enabling users to step through a series of pages while capturing input and facilitating navigation.\r\n\r\n"
