  "StateMachines.ecore": "The metamodel defines a Hierarchical State Machine. This metamodel is designed to model states, transitions, events, actions, and conditions in a state machine context.\r\n\r\n### Main Entities and Their Purpose:\r\n\r\n1. **StateMachine**: This is the primary container that holds a collection of `states` and `transitions`. It represents the whole state machine structure and includes metadata, like a description.\r\n\r\n2. **State**: Each state can be either an **initial** state or a **final** state. The `State` class captures the identity of the state through its `name` and distinguishes its role in the state machine through boolean attributes.\r\n\r\n3. **Transition**: This entity represents the movement from one state to another (`from` and `to` references), dictated by an `event`. Transitions may also have associated `actions` and `guards`, which define what happens during the transition and the conditions required to execute the transition, respectively.\r\n\r\n4. **Event**: This class represents occurrences that can trigger transitions within the state machine. Events have a `name` attribute, which identifies the event that can initiate a transition.\r\n\r\n5. **CompositeState**: A specialized type of `State` that can encompass other states and potentially allows building nested state machines. This enhances the modeling of hierarchical state behavior.\r\n\r\n6. **Action**: Defines executable code that occurs as part of a transition. It has a `code` attribute that specifies what to execute during the transition. This may be pseudocode, or code in a programming language, depending on the usage.\r\n\r\n7. **Guard**: A condition that must be satisfied for a transition to occur. It comprises a `condition` attribute, which is typically expressed as a string that evaluates to true or false. The expression of the guard may be pseudocode, or code in a programming language, depending on the usage.\r\n\r\n8. **TimeEvent**: A subtype of `Event`, which introduces time-based triggering for transitions. It adds a `time` attribute to denote the time at which the event should occur. It is a number in milliseconds.\r\n\r\n### Relationships:\r\n- **Containment**: The `StateMachine` contains multiple `State` and `Transition` elements, establishing a composition relationship.\r\n- **Transitions** are linked to `State` (from and to), which facilitates the modeling of state changes.\r\n- **Events, Actions, and Guards** are linked to `Transition`, thereby defining the dynamics of how and when transitions occur."
