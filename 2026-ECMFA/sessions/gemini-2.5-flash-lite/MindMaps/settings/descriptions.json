  "MindMap.ecore": "The metamodel describes Mind Mappings, encapsulated in two main classes: `Map` and `Concept`.\r\n\r\n1. **Map**:\r\n   - The **Map** class represents a mind map, which is a visual tool used for organizing information. It is characterized by:\r\n     - **name**: A string attribute that specifies the title of the mind map.\r\n     - **description**: A string attribute providing additional details about the mind map\u0027s purpose or content.\r\n     - **root**: A containment reference to a `Concept`. This indicates that a mind map begins with a root concept, serving as the central idea around which related concepts will be organized.\r\n\r\n2. **Concept**:\r\n   - The **Concept** class represents an individual idea or node within the mind map. It features:\r\n     - **name**: A string attribute for the name of the concept.\r\n     - **description**: A string attribute that offers an explanation of the concept.\r\n     - **subConcepts**: A containment reference allowing a concept to have multiple child concepts (sub-concepts), enabling a hierarchical organization.\r\n     - **parent**: A reference to the parent `Concept` in the hierarchy (this is the opposite reference of subConcepts).\r\n     - **relatedTo**: A reference that can link this concept to other concepts, enhancing relational understanding among various ideas.\r\n\r\n### Relationships\r\n- The `Map` class is a top-level entity that contains a single `root` `Concept`, which acts as the foundational idea for the mind map.\r\n- The `Concept` class supports a recursive structure where each concept can have multiple `subConcepts`, all of which are child nodes to the respective parent concept.\r\n- The `relatedTo` feature enables concepts to connect with additional concepts, fostering a web of associations that mirrors the exploratory nature of mind mapping."
