  "ProcessModelling.ecore": "The metamodel defines a structure for representing process models in a workflow or task management system. The core entity in this metamodel is the **ProcessModel**, which acts as a container for **nodes** and **edges**. \r\n\r\n### Key Entities and Their Relationships:\r\n\r\n1. **ProcessModel**:\r\n   - This EClass serves as the overarching structure that holds the elements of the process. It contains:\r\n     - **nodes**: A collection of **Node** instances (which can be different types of nodes such as tasks, gateways, etc.) that represent various activities or decision points in the process.\r\n     - **edges**: A collection of **FlowEdge** instances that define the connections and flow relationships between the nodes.\r\n\r\n2. **Node**:\r\n   - This is an abstract class serving as a base for various specific types of nodes in the process. It is not instantiated directly but is subclassed by other EClasses representing concrete nodes.\r\n\r\n3. **Task** and its specializations:\r\n   - **Task**: Represents a unit of work within the process. It can hold a name attribute that describes the task.\r\n   - **InitialTask** and **FinalTask**: Subclasses of Task, representing the entry and exit points of the process, respectively.\r\n\r\n4. **Gateway and its specializations**:\r\n   - **ChoiceGateway**: An abstract class representing a decision point in the process which can have multiple outgoing edges based on certain conditions.\r\n   - **ExclusiveChoice** and **MultiChoice**: These are specific types of ChoiceGateways that manage exclusive (one) vs. multiple options for flow.\r\n\r\n5. **FlowEdge**:\r\n   - This class defines the directed connections between nodes, specifying an input node and an output node, thereby establishing a flow from one part of the process to another. Each FlowEdge has a name for identification. 5. **ConditionalFlowEdge**:\r\n   - A subtype of FlowEdge that has a condition. These edges are ONLY used when the input node is a ChoiceGateway (either ExclusiveChoice or MultiChoice).\r\nIMPORTANT: MultiChoice and ExclusiveChoice objects have as output ConditionalFlowEdges, which carry a condition. These these edges are connected to other tasks or gateways."
