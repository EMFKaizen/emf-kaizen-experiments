  "http://www.eclipse.org/emf/2002/Ecore": "This is a subset of the ECore meta-model, which is used in the EMF/Eclipse framework. The relevant classes are:\r\n\r\n1. **EClassifier**: This is an abstract class that serves as the base for defining types within the Ecore metamodel. It includes operations to check instances and obtain classifier identifiers. It sets the foundation for other classifiers such as EClass, EDataType, and EEnum.\r\n\r\n2. **EClass**: A key component representing classes in the model. It can contain both attributes (EAttributes) and references (EReferences), allowing it to be structured to represent complex data models. EClass provides methods for managing its structural features and defining relationships with super types, detailing its hierarchical nature as it can inherit from other EClasses.\r\n\r\n3. **EAttribute** and **EReference**: Both are types of EStructuralFeature, with EAttribute representing simple attributes (like strings, numbers) and EReference capturing relationships between EClasses. They allow EClass to define the internal structure and interconnections necessary for making rich data models.\r\n\r\n4. **EDataType**: A specialized type of EClassifier that represents a data type, which can be primitive (like int, string) or complex (like user-defined classes). It includes characteristics such as whether it is serializable.\r\n\r\n5. **EEnum** and **EEnumLiteral**: EEnum represents enumerations (a special kind of data type consisting of a set of named values), while EEnumLiteral defines the individual elements of an enum. Both support operations for accessing and managing the literals they contain.\r\n\r\n6. **EModelElement**, **ENamedElement**, **EObject**, and **EPackage**: These are foundational elements serving different purposes. EModelElement provides a common base for model elements, ENamedElement denotes elements with names, and EObject represents instances of models. EPackage is a container for EClassifiers, encapsulating the model\u0027s namespace and organization.\r\n\r\n**Relationships**: \r\n- Each of the EClasses has a defined inheritance structure, creating a hierarchy (e.g., EClass inherits from EClassifier, which in turn inherits from ENamedElement). \r\n- EClasses can have multiple EAttributes and EReferences, facilitating complex interrelationships and modeling capabilities.\r\n- EPackages contain multiple EClassifiers, reinforcing a modular structure for organizing models and their components.\r\n\r\nOverall, this subset highlights the foundational architecture of the Ecore metamodel, designed for creating often complex data models with clear structural hierarchies and relationships. It forms a core part of the Eclipse Modeling Framework, enabling users to construct and manipulate a diverse range of models efficiently."
